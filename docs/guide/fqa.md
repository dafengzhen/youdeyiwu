# FQA

Documenting common questions in the hope that they may be of assistance to you.

## What is the best way to use this project?

By default, you can use the pre-built Docker image to experience or deploy the project.

If you want to add custom features or implement functionality that suits your business logic, it is recommended to use secondary development methods.

## Is there an online demo available for the project?

Due to various reasons, we are unable to provide an online demo.

However, you can follow the steps in the [Quick Start](./getting-started.md#installation-steps) guide to deploy and experience it in one click.

Alternatively, you can browse the example images on the [Documentation Home](../index.md) page for a basic understanding.
