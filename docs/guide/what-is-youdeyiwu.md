# Developer Technology {#developer-technology}

Youdeyiwu consists of both frontend and backend components.

The backend is developed using [Spring Boot 3](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), the frontend is developed using [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org), and the database used is [MySQL 8](https://www.mysql.com).

::: info Side Note

If there is spare time in the future, desktop and app development may be considered. The idea is to expand on the backend API utilization and frontend browsing.

However, developing other platforms is not the main focus. The main focus is still on frontend and backend development.
