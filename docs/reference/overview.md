# Overview

The interface definition uses the OpenAPI specification, which can be found at the project path [```src/main/resources/openapi.yaml```](https://github.com/dafengzhen/youdeyiwu/blob/main/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml).

You can import this file into API testing tools that support this specification, such as: [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest), [Apifox](https://apifox.com), etc.

The document also includes API definitions for reference, which can be used in conjunction with the OpenAPI specification.
